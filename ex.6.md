# 🕵️‍♂️ **Experiment No. 06 — Digital Forensic Analysis using Sleuth Kit (TSK)**

## 🔍 **Overview**

The **Sleuth Kit (TSK)** 🧰 is a versatile suite of command-line tools used in **digital forensics**.  
It enables investigators to analyze disk images 🖥️, uncover deleted files 🗑️, and extract critical digital evidence 🔎 from storage devices.  
This document walks through the complete process of using Sleuth Kit on a **Windows** system to perform forensic analysis.

## ⚙️ **Step 1: Installing Sleuth Kit**

1. **Download the Tool:**  
   - Head over to the official Sleuth Kit page or use this link:  
     👉 [Download Sleuth Kit](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1ilSFY7Tqn2L7AjQGhq8yJ8kixc_xTU-v)  
   - Choose the latest stable **Windows-compatible** version.

2. **Installation Process:**  
   - Run the installer and follow the setup wizard 🪄.  
   - Once done, TSK will be ready to use on your system!

---

## 💾 **Step 2: Acquire the Disk Image**

Before analysis, a **forensic disk image** (a perfect bit-by-bit copy) of the device is needed.

1. **Create Disk Image:**  
   - Use tools like **FTK Imager** 🧮 or **`dd`** to create an exact copy.  
   - Save it in a TSK-supported format: `.dd`, `.raw`, `.img`, or `.E01`.

2. **Sample Evidence Files:**  
   - For this lab, download the following from the provided link:  
     📁 `4Dell Latitude CPi.E01`  
     📁 `4Dell Latitude CPi.E02`

---

## 💽 **Step 3: Mounting the Disk Image (Optional)**

Mounting lets you access the disk image as if it were a normal drive.

- Use **OSFMount** 🧷 to mount the image in **read-only mode**.  
- 🔒 *Note: This is optional but helps when browsing the file system.*

## 🧭 **Step 4: File System Analysis with TSK**

Now let’s dive into Sleuth Kit tools 🧠 to inspect the file system.

### 🧑‍💻 Navigate to the TSK Directory


```bash
cd "C:\Program Files (x86)\sleuthkit-4.14.0-win32\bin"
```
