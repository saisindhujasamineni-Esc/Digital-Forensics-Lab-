# Experiment -1 : Evidence Acquisition using FTK Imager Tool

## Aim
To acquire and preserve digital evidence from storage media using **FTK Imager**, ensuring integrity, accuracy, and admissibility in forensic investigations.

---

## Description
FTK Imager is a forensic imaging tool developed by AccessData. It allows investigators to create forensic images (bit-by-bit copies) of storage media such as hard drives, USBs, and memory cards without altering the original evidence.  
The tool also provides options to verify evidence integrity using cryptographic hash functions (MD5, SHA1, SHA256).  
By using FTK Imager, investigators can securely extract, preview, and analyze data while maintaining forensic soundness.
